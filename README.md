## What is Crash Map
My app CrashMap is a unique app which cautions users when they are entering a crash zone while driving. The crash zones are the areas in Virginia where there is a high frequency of crashes. When you are near these zones, this app CrashMap will notify you, informing you to drive carefully and cautiously while passing these crash zones.
